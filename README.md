# RSpec Thread Safety Tests

This repo exists to hopefully gather some test cases that fail due to a lack of thread safety in RSpec.

To run the tests:

    rake

If they pass, I don't have any failing rspec thread safety tests.  This is either because I haven't written
any or because RSpec is thread safe in those circumstances.  If there are any tests here, you can assume it's
the latter :)
